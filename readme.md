# 2048

One of the addictive game i have ever played after subway surfer. The day I played this game I dreamed of creating my version of it. Finally after months I am able to finish it.

I tried to make it as generic as possible. This implementation can be configured to create many variations of the game without writing any code.

Features of this implementation

-   can be configured to create game board of any size
-   can be themed easily
-   even the collision formula, (what happens when to tiles with same value collieds) can be changed from the configuration.

There are lot many feature I want to add to it. Hope i will get time to do so.

## Getting Started

1. clone the repo
2. `npm install --save-dev`
3. `npm start`
4. goto [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

Check **dotenv** file for more configuration options.
